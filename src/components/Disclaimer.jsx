        RISKS OF DIGITAL ASSET TRADING AND INVESTMENT
      </h2>

      <div className="mt-3 text-left">
        As a customer or potential customer of the platform, before you pay any
        money or digital assets to VOLTECK, you should pay attention to the
        following matters:
      </div>
      <div className="mt-3 text-left">
        VOLTECK may not hold a license to provide services to you through the
        platform in your jurisdiction. Please note that this may mean that if
        our business fails, you will not be able to recover all the money or
        digital assets you paid us.
      </div>
      <div className="mt-3 text-left">
        If you are not familiar with the digital asset, you should not trade the
        digital asset. Digital asset trading may not be for you. Once you
        conduct transactions on the platform, your behavior will be deemed as
        voluntary and you will be deemed to be fully familiar with digital
        assets and legal coins (such as participating in transactions).
      </div>
      <div className="mt-3 text-left">
        You should be aware that the value of digital assets may fluctuate
        greatly. You should purchase digital assets only if you are willing and
        prepared to take the risk of losing all the funds you have invested in
        such assets.
      </div>
      <div className="mt-3 text-left">
        The past performance may not be indicative of future results, and the
        value of any digital assets available on the platform may fluctuate,
        therefore you should not assume that the future performance of any
        specific asset will be profitable or equal to the corresponding past
        performance level. Each decision you make should be determined with
        reference to the specific information available for such assets and not
        based upon the success of past recommendations. VOLTECK does not
        guarantee the performance of any transaction or investment, the return
        of any client's principal or the realization of any rate of return
      </div>
      <div className="mt-3 text-left">

        significant risks, including possible loss of principal. The performance
        and return of any digital asset can change significantly over time.

      <div className="mt-3 text-left">
        The trading and investment of digital assets available on the platform
        is not suitable for everyone. Only after you have carefully read the
